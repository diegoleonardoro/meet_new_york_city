                <p>
                    Thanks for taking the time to browse this website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website has a very strong personal value to me. It is a reflection of some of the most
                    meaningful experiences that I have had in New York City.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born in Colombia, and I have the fortune to be living in NYC since 2016. I came to this city
                    for a Masters and my first job was at a non profit organization called Historic Districts Council
                    (HDC).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, HDC has worked to preserve the architectural heritage of NYC, but they hired me
                    because they wanted to explore an additional focus to their mission: preserving NYCâ€™s cultural
                    heritage of underrepresented communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In doing this job, I have known this city in a way that I could have never imagined. I have worked
                    with communities all over The Bronx, from Hunts Points to Fieldstone; I have met with elected
                    officials and community groups from Sunset Park, Bushwick, Jackson Heights, Astoria, Flushing,
                    Elmhurst, and other neighborhoods across the city with substantial immigrant, Hispanic and African
                    American communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this process, I have come to the conclusion that what makes NYC so unique are not the most
                    obvious destinations and associations that people have of this city. It is the cultures, the
                    neighborhoods, the communities that live beyond the skyscrapers and Central Park what make this
                    city so unique.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a web-based project that aims to highlight the overlooked neighborhoods of NYC by
                    encouraging residents to write about their favorite places in their neighborhoods, and explain why
                    those places are important to them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Working at the Historic Districts Council I have realized that all neighborhoods have passionate
                    residents who love the place they live in, who know the history, the best restaurants, destinations
                    and the people who make their neighborhood meaningful not only to them but to the history of the
                    city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These residents are the right people to show their neighborhood to visitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I mentioned, this web site has a strong personal value to me because it is a reflection of some
                    of the most meaningful experiences that I have had in New York City. One of those experiences is
                    the work with communities that I already explained, and the other one is my journey to become a
                    better professional with skill sets that allow me to build something that can actually have an
                    impact in society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I majored in journalism and I have a Masters in Strategic Communications. Three years ago I felt
                    the need to complement my communications skills with technical skills. I was motivated by the idea
                    of becoming a data journalist, so I went to a data science bootcamp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since 2018, I have been coding and studying to become a better programmer. This website is the
                    result of that process. I coded every single line of this website, and while it is not perfect yet,
                    it shows how my idea of highlighting communities could eventually look like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I win the David Prize, I will be able to partner with more programmers and web designers to make
                    this platform look as beautiful as you could imagine.
